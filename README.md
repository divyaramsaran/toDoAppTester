# JSR Test Drive: A Hands-On Testing Project

## Problem Statement

Modern JavaScript projects demand reliable automated testing for correctness and maintainability. In this project, you’ll create a simple web-based **To-Do List** application and gain in-depth experience using the JSR (JavaScript Standard Runner) test framework to write, organize, and run tests. This assignment is designed to help you build practical skills in writing unit, integration, and functional tests using best practices with JSR.

## Project Name

**JSR Test Drive: To-Do List Application Testing**

---

## Functional Requirements

- Build a minimal To-Do List application (vanilla JS/React/Vue/etc.—your choice).
- Implement core features:
  - Add a new to-do item
  - Mark a to-do as completed/incomplete
  - Delete a to-do item
  - Filter (show all, active, or completed)
- Write a comprehensive test suite using JSR:
  - Unit tests for independent functions
  - Integration tests for how components interact
  - Functional tests simulating user behavior
- Achieve at least 85% code coverage as reported by JSR.

---

## Input

- **User Interactions:** (for functional/integration tests)
  - Adding, toggling, deleting, and filtering todos.
- **Test Data:**
  - Mock to-do entries.
- **Code Modules:**
  - To-do list logic split into functions or components for unit and integration testing.

---

## Output

- **Application:** A working web or CLI-based To-Do List app.
- **Test Reports:** Console reports from JSR showing all test results.
- **Coverage Report:** Output from JSR indicating percentage of tested code.
- **Badges/Logs:** (Optional) Coverage and test status badges for your README.

### Example Test Output

✓ should add a new to-do item
✓ should mark a to-do as completed
✓ should delete a to-do item
✓ filters active to-dos correctly
Coverage: 93%
All tests passed!
